Password Manager
This is a Python password manager program that allows users to store and generate passwords for different websites. With this program, you can create unique and secure passwords for each website you use, without having to remember them all.

How to Use
To start using the password manager, run the main.py file in your Python environment. You will be prompted to choose an action from the following options:

Add a new password: Enter the website name, user name, and password for the website. You can also choose to have the program generate a new password for you by pressing "Generate Password" in the password field.

Search for a password: Enter the website name to search for the password. If a password is found, it will be displayed on the screen and automatically copied to your clipboard.

All passwords are saved in a data.json file in the same directory as the program.
